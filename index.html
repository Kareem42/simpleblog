                   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: italic;">
                   When it comes to love, some men struggle with expressing it. Others have no shame in expressing it.  Growing up, 
                   we are told to be tough at all times and not express your feelings. However, there is a percentage, about 5%, of men who does express themselves
                   to their significant other. I am part of the 5% of men, who will find creative ways to express how much I love my wife. So instead of doing the "cliche" ways of expressing love through 
                   showering her in with gifts, money, clothes, shoes, purses, etc., I've decided to blog 34 reasons why I chose this woman to be my wife. Full disclosure, some of the things I will say within this blog will be a little graphic to most readers. 
                   So, please understand that I am being very honest and open about everything I am about to say. Alright, here goes:</p>
                   </span><br>
                   <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">God Fearing</li>
                   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: italic;">
                   When some people hear this phrase, they automatically think that you are literally afraid of God.  This is not the case with this woman. This woman worships and honors God in so many ways. I would list them all
                   but there is one way that drew my attention to her when we first met.  Through the midst of all of struggles, as well as my struggles, she continued to praise and glorify God.  Coming from a religious background,
                   I never understood how she did it.  Yet, she prayed for herself, for me, her family, my family, everyone that she could possibly think of. She had her own style for praise and it rubbed off on me. I struggled with
                   it at first because I knew how to pray but I didn't know HOW to pray.  She introduced me to Crossroads Church and since then, my life has never been the same again.  For that, I am forever thankful for introducting
                   me to God and for him bringing you in my life.</p>
                   <br>
                   <li style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;"> Loving the Unloved </li>
                   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: italic;">
                    Here is something that not too many people know about me. Yes, I know this is not about supposed to be about me and the main purpose of the blog is to express to the world why and how much I love my wife, but 
                    you will have a better understanding with what I am about to say. I have dealt with a thought in the back of my head for most of life that I could never be truly loved by anyone of the opposite sex.  Most of the 
                    women I have dealt with "like" me or "like" being around me because they thought I was cool. Yet, as time went by, I started getting attached to them, thinking that this person could be the one for me. So, I would 
                    shower them with compliments, spend money that I don't even have to spend, even co-sign for a car, once.  Yet, none of that kept them around long because they only viewed me as a friend or should I stay in today's world, 
                    a simp. So my heart got broken and it stayed that way for a very long time because I felt that I was unloveable. In Jazmine Sullivan, these women made a hoe out of me. I felt that was they only way that I can be loved, but
                    I didn't realize that it was way deeper than that. I was having an internal battle with myself because I didn't know how to love myself, let alone loving someone else. But then, I met you and maannnn, when I tell you this 
                    woman with through hell with me, I mean she walked on hot coal and stood there firmly. She showed me how to love myself again, how to battle my self-doubt, and how to deal with my depression by praying with me and for me.
                    Even til this day, this woman gives me love even when I don't feel like I deserve to be loved. I can't express enough how much her love, which in my opinion, is similar to God's love, means to me. 
                  </p>

                  <li style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">That WAP though...</li>
                  <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: italic;">
                    Now, here is where it gets a bit intimate and personal. So again, FULL DISCLOSURE, make sure no children or the faint of heart, aren't around when you are reading this.  So, most of us of have heard the WAP song by Cardi B and
                    Megan the Stallion by now. I don't know if this is my wife's theme song or what, but this girl puts it on me like no other. So good to the point where I want to be the one to make her breakfast in the morning, butt ass naked, with a 
                    apron like Melvin was in the movie, "Baby Boy", after Jodi's mom put it on him. I am not going to give you the XXX details, but some couples know EXACTLY what I mean. But it's not what she does to me, it's how she does it to me. She showed me that 
                    it's all about enjoying the moment, taking my time with everything, and I mean EVERYTHING!! But honestly, the way she taught me how to make love to her is something that is unteachable and remarkable. It opened up sides of me that 
                    I never knew I had and it continues to grow on the daily basis. And now, I can't get enough of it.</p>              
                    </ul>
                     <br> 
                     <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: italic;">
                    Ok, ok, I know I was supposed to have listed 34 reasons why I love my wife so much. Yet, I decided to spare you the excruciating headache of reading all 34 reasons 
                    by cutting it down to 3 reasons only. There is more to our love story but I'd rather save all of that for another time and place.  My reason for doing this blog is 
                    to be an example for men (and women, but mainly men)to use their skills to come up with creative ways to express their love for their significant other. I've decided to use the 
                    skills I have learned in the last 2 months, while trying to become a Front-End Web Developer, to create a site to start a new movement for men 
                    in the tech industry. I know some guys have a hard time expressing how they feel about someone they love. So I'm using my platfrom to be a 
                    mortar for them. Even if you struggle with telling someone how you feel in person, you have other ways to do just that and this is one way you can do it. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-style: italic;">
                    I will leave you with this little advice. Take a risk of expressing your love to someone you really care about and don't be ashamed about it. Little things like what I have created goes a very long way 
                    and if that person ever feels depressed, stressed out, or feels unloved, they can always refer back to the blog that will remind them that someone loves them enough to 
                    confess their love for them, just as God confess his love for us as his children.

          My name is Justin C. Alcendor. I created this blog for family and friends to wish my wife an 
          Happy 34th Birthday, rather than doing it via social media. This is just my way of telling her thank you all of the love and support 
          she has giving me our the years. With the support she gives me on the daily basis, it gives me the strength
          to follow my dream to become a Front-End Web Developer. This is my first blog I have created since I started learning
          Web Development 2 months ago. Please feel to comment your thoughts about this blog through the contact area. I can, also,
          be contacted via social media links below.</p>
